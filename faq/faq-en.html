<p align="left"><font face="Arial Black">Question: I'm new here on the server. How can I get money?<br>
Answer: New players can do some side-jobs like taxi driver, policeman, medic and 
firefighter. For that you need to steal a corresponding vehicle and press Caps 
Lock to start working.<br>
Also new players have access to several missions. All currently available 
missions are marked with green question mark, not available - with a white one. 
Each mission has its own level requirement.<br>
Also you can make money by stealing secureicars (marked with a dollar sign). 
They periodically spawn and drive around the city, you should steal them and 
bring to a marked place.<br>
You have ability to rob shops. Enter any shop (among ones which are marked on 
the map), aim with a firearm and hold this position for some period of time.<br>
Among side-jobs there are also bus driver, garbage trucker and subway driver 
jobs.<br>
The most efficient way of making cash and EXP is doing daily objectives. To get 
known with a list of objectives you should open player menu (I button) and 
select &quot;Daily objectives&quot;. This list gets refreshed every day. During one day 
you can complete these objectives only once. After completing you should wait 
until the next day to get ability to complete them again.<br>
<br>
Question: How can I know my level? For what is it needed?<br>
Answer: Level is displayed at the top of the screen as a white stripe. A left 
number displays your current level and a right one - the following level, the 
bar itself displays the EXP progress until next level.<br>
Experience points are given for almost all types of activities on the server. 
Reaching specific level provides you access to a new content, such as: new 
missions, businesses, organization, etc.<br>
<br>
Question: I've bought a snack in a shop. How can eat it? How to open the 
inventory? For what can it be used?<br>
Answer: Inventory, or actually - player menu, can be opened with I button. There 
you can eat snacks, wear armor vest bought from a gun shop, use ammo box, play 
animations, invite people to your team, etc.<br>
<br>
Question: What is a business and for what is it needed?<br>
Answer: Business lets you get a passive income, which depends on multiplier. 
This multiplier can be increased by doing business missions. Each business has 
its own set of missions.<br>
All businesses are separated between categories. When you own several businesses 
of same type, you increase multiplier increase rate by doing missions.<br>
Income is received once per in-game day in 00:00. After that, income multiplier 
gets lowered. If you stop taking care of your business, its multiplier will 
reach zero and you will stop receiving income.<br>
Businesses are also needed to get access to heists (via organization). Some 
businesses provide access to some additional side-jobs.<br>
<br>
Question: What is organization and for what is it needed?<br>
Answer: Organization provides access to several missions, which are available 
only to owners of organization. Also there you can launch heists and preparation 
missions for them.<br>
Besides that, you get ability to create your own clan and invite other players 
there. Clan provides some bonuses like special gun shop with lowered prices, and 
increased payment for organization missions.<br>
Also clan lets you capture territories, which are marked with squares (these 
markers can be seen only by clan members). Every in-game day in 00:00 all clan 
members receive payment, which depends on number of captured territories. If 
someone starts capturing your area, you will be alarmed and there will be some 
time for you to react and protect it. (edited)<br>

Question: Can I buy a house or a car? How to do that?<br>
Answer: Yes, you can. Apartments are marked around the map. Each apartment has 
its number of garage places, which can be used to store vehicles.<br>
Besides that, apartment can be use as spawn point. If you own only one 
apartment, then you will be spawned in it after joining the server. If you 
several apartments, then you will be asked to select a desired spawn point.<br>
Vehicles are separated between categories: land, marine, aircraft. Land vehicles 
can be purchased in any car shop. Other vehicle types require purchased boatyard 
and/or helipad.<br>
When you own several apartments/boatyards/helipads, their number of garage 
places are summed up.<br>
<br>
Question: How to spawn purchased vehicles?<br>
Answer: Land vehicles can be spawned via apartment or phone in &quot;Car delivery&quot; 
option. Boats and helicopters are spawned at boatyards and helipads.<br>
<br>

and upgrades (engine, brakes, nitro, hydraulics, armor, bullet-proof tires, fire 
protection).<br>
<br>
Question: How to start a heist/robbery? What should I do for that?<br>
Answer: You must own an organization. Also you must own a business(es). Each 
business type unlocks a specific heist.<br>
Heists can be described as a set of several preparation missions and heist 
itself. Preparation missions are separated between necessary and optional. 
Optional missions could be ignored, but their accomplishment may affect the 
heist in a positive way.<br>
<br>
Question: Is it possible to do missions with a friend/another player(s)?<br>
Answer: Yes. In order to do that you should open the player menu (I button) and 
select &quot;Co-op&quot; item. There you can invite players and remove them from your 
team.<br>
Doing missions together will lead to reward separation.<br>
<br>
Question: What else can I do besides doing missions/heists?<br>
Answer: The server can provide a selection of several multiplayer game modes: 
deathmatch, gun game, race, pursuit race, derby, survival, APC battle, etc.<br>
During all game modes you receive some cash/EXP income, but the highest reward 
you can get by winning.<br>
For game modes like deathmatch or gun game you don't need to buy weapons. 
Weapons are given automatically.<br>
All these modes can be left before their ending by entering player menu and 
selecting &quot;Leave event&quot; item.<br>

Question: What is agency and for what is it needed?<br>
Answer: Agency provides you access to a set of missions - contracts. By 
completing them you not only receive a payment but you also can unlock 
VIP-contracts. Such contracts are sets of consistent plot-related missions; 
payment is received only after full completion of all of them.<br>
Besides that owning an agency lets you receive contract killer missions. They 
are marked with a white person blip on the map which marks a location a payphone 
from where you can get a target to kill. Objective text will specify a bonus 
condition. If you meet this condition, you receive an increased reward. New

<br>
Question: What can I do in Internet cafe?<br>
Answer: There you can start special types of side-jobs, which are available only 
for owners of an organization and two businesses: drug dealing and gunrunning.<br>
During drug dealing you need to find a dealer. Each dealer is interested in a 
specific kind of drug and can sell one kind. When you sell great amount of drugs 
of same type at a time, you receive a significantly higher income, comparing to 
selling low amount. Each drug type has its own rarity and price. Current amount 
of drugs you hold can be checked in &quot;Drug inventory&quot; section of player menu (I 
button).<br>
During gunrunning you use your personal van to buy guns from a dealer and sell 
them to clients. Any gun can be bought, but there is no 100% chance that this 
gun will be purchased in such amount by the clients. So it's better to buy 
average amounts of guns of each type to lower the risk. But also you can risk 
and try to cover the costs.</font></p>
